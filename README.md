# Game-Compiler
This was a part of a project where I, along with a friend made a compiler for a simple game using flex and bison. 
Initially, we started with 1 game but ended up making 3 games. 

In the first game, there are 3 objects, out of which only 1 contains a prize. User has to move the agent using movement keys and choose one of the 3 objects.
In the second game, the user uses the movement keys to kick the football here and there.
The third game has a time constraint, you have to collect maximum number of apples before the timer expires.
