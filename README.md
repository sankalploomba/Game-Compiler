# Game-Compiler
This was a part of a project where I, along with a friend made a compiler for a simple game using flex and bison. 
Initially, we started with 1 game but ended up making 3 games. 

In the first game, there are 3 objects, out of which only 1 contains a prize. User has to move the agent using movement keys and choose one of the 3 objects.
In the second game, the user uses the movement keys to kick the football here and there.
In the third game, the user has to collect apples in minimum number of steps possible.
